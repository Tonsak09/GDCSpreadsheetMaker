The bottom left of the application will showcase your current line. I recommend remaking the spreadsheet occasionally in order to avoid crashes or unknown scenarios. This is not a well tested or thouroughly designed product but instead is a productivity tool made for only to be used essentially once. The spreadsheet will be generated one directoty above the godot project file (in the repo) and it will be called out.csv. 

In total there are 683 sessions.
